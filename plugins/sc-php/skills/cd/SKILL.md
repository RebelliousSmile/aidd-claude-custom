## Transversal rules

- Read [host portability](../../references/host-portability.md), [the common contract](../../references/cd-contract.md), and [the project schema](../../references/cd-project-contract.schema.json) before acting.
- Keep one root owner and treat JavaScript and CSS as bounded contributors in WordPress applications.
- Keep code, configuration, migrations, database, editorial content, and media as separate named surfaces.
- Never create another environment, reset WordPress, destroy containers, import a database during setup, or deploy merely because configuration was requested.
- Select an exact target id, phase and `deploy:*` operation; refuse ambiguous multi-target requests and every target-to-target or pull flow.
- Read [differential synchronization](../../references/cd-differential-sync.md) for staging data or media. Production mutable data, editorial content and uploads are target-authoritative.
